Learning GitHub helps me collaborate with other developers.
Version control makes it easy to track and revert changes.
Branches allow me to work on new features without affecting the main code.
Merge conflicts happen when two people change the same part of a file.
Practicing daily will make me confident with Git and GitHub.

Git log shows the history of all commits in a repository.
I can clone a repository to get a copy on my local machine.
The git status command tells me what changes are staged or unstaged.
Pulling updates from GitHub keeps my local code up to date.
Pushing changes shares my latest work with the remote repository.
